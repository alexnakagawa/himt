# Tensight

Tensight is a large passion project turned start-up started in June of 2019.

- It was first conceptualized as a database of Asian-American Athletes.

- By the end of the summer, the database had grown to encompass Asian athletes from many of the big sports.

- **Now, it aims to be a platform for athletes from _non-traditional backgrounds_ to play sports _at the next level_.**

# Humble Beginnings

I was a complete novice to all things web development before this project.
Only thing I knew somewhat well was _creating databases_.

Still, **we all start from somewhere**. I saw being contained in self-quarantine as a golden opportunity to learn something new.

```shellscript
npx degit sveltejs/template tensight
```

# The Right Tool for the Job

I decided on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for my new project. It's server-side rendering was blazing fast, the templating was extremely user-friendly, and had some of the best documentation I had ever read.

        marginRight: 'auto',

# The Right Tool for the Job (pt. 2)

As a result the readability of my code has significantly improved.

Svelte has helped me mature more as a fullstack developer than anything I've ever tried.

Trust me -- I went through tutorial hell with others like React and Vue to get myself to Svelte (my savior).

## An Example in Code

From this in React...

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default () => {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);

  function handleChangeA(event) {
    setA(+event.target.value);
  }

  function handleChangeB(event) {
    setB(+event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="number" value={a} onChange={handleChangeA}/>
      <input type="number" value={b} onChange={handleChangeB}/>

      <p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
---
...to this in Svelte:

```svelte
<script>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={a}>
<input type="number" bind:value={b}>

<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
```
