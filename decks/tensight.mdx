# Tensight

Tensight is a large passion project turned start-up started in June of 2019.

- It was first conceptualized as a database of Asian-American Athletes.
- By the end of the summer, the database had grown to encompass Asian athletes from many of the big sports.
- **Now, it aims to be a platform for athletes from _non-traditional backgrounds_ to play sports _at the next level_.**

# Humble Beginnings

I was a complete novice to all things web development before this project.
Only thing I knew somewhat well was _creating databases_.

Still, **we all start from somewhere**. I saw being contained in self-quarantine as a golden opportunity to learn something new.

```shellscript
npx degit sveltejs/template tensight
```

# The Right Tool for the Job

I decided on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for my new project. It's server-side rendering was blazing fast, the templating was extremely user-friendly, and had some of the best documentation I had ever read.
