## Motivations

I was watching my favorite live-coding streamer [@noopkat](https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat/) on her Twitch channel, when she mentioned that she wanted a better way to let people know what she's been working on. That comment during her stream got me thinking about ways to be able to kill two birds with one stone:

1. Be able to save important snippets as you go along the process and present it to others in a natural way.
2. If you learn some new syntax or trick during the coding process, you'll be able to go back and see it used within the context of your own project.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository to anywhere you'd like.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alexnakagawa/himt.git
```

* `npm install`
* `npm run start --proj="NAME_OF_PROJECT_SUBFOLDER"`
